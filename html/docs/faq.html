<H1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</H1>
<P>Thank you for looking at the FAQ.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">How do I read .epub files?</H2>
<P>On Windows, Mac, and *nix, the Calibre application is recommended
for reading and conversions.</P>
<P>For other platforms, please use you favorite search engine to look
up &quot;epub &lt;your platform&gt;&quot;.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">How do I read .mobi and .azw3 files?</H2>
<P>These are Amazon Kindle files, which can be read using Kindle
devices or the Kindle app on supported platforms.</P>
<P>These files can also be opened by the Calibre application.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">How do I edit file descriptions?</H2>
<P>File descriptions are stored in &quot;.nfo&quot; files, which are
plain text files.</P>
<P>For a file or directory called &quot;foo.bar&quot;, create a plain
text file named &quot;foo.bar.nfo&quot; and place the description in
there.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Why do I need GnuPG?</H2>
<P>GnuPG is only needed if you would like to sign your messages and
create an identity.</P>
<P>You do not need GnuPG to browse or to post anonymous comments.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">How do I install GnuPG?</H2>
<P>To install GPG, go to <A HREF="http://gnupg.org/">gnupg.org</A>.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">How do I create an identity?</H2>
<P>You must use a program called GnuPG (aka GPG). It is a
command-line program. It is available for your OS. You must learn how
to use it. It is not very hard.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>To make a new key/identity for yourself, type <CODE CLASS="western">gpg
--gen-key</CODE> and follow the instructions. You typically only have
to do this once. It is like creating an account.</P>
<P>It is not necessary to register on the server before posting a
signed message.</P>
<P>If you would like to set a username, just paste your public key
into the submission field.</P>
<P>If you get frustrated or stuck, ask a Linux user you know to help
you.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">How do I sign my messages?</H2>
<P>First, you must install GPG and create an identity, as described
in the question above.</P>
<P>To sign a new message, first save it to a text file, like
<U>SomeFile.txt</U>.</P>
<P>Then type <CODE CLASS="western">gpg --clearsign </CODE><CODE CLASS="western"><U>SomeFile.txt</U></CODE>
to sign the contents of that file and save it as SomeFile.txt.asc.</P>
<P>Alternatively, you can type <CODE CLASS="western">gpg --clearsign</CODE>
and type your message into the command prompt window. Press Ctrl+D
(or Ctrl+W on Windows) to finish and display the message, now signed.</P>
