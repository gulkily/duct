I am at IC, about to head into Chinatown for some classes.

Last night, on my way back, I ran into my friend Stepan, who sometimes hangs out in Union Square. He is 56, drinks, walks on crutches, doesn't have a place to stay. He used to stay at the Bowery, but got beat up while sleeping. Before that, Breaking Ground took him on, but put him with a roommate who was a drug user with a lot of traffic. We rode the train for a couple of hours.

He used to be a schoolteacher in the USSR, but lost his job after the breakup. He moved to the U.S. and worked construction, making $200-300 a day, and sending a lot of it back home. He was in an accident and got his feet crushed, and hasn't worked since then. He wants to go back to Ukraine to live with his sister, but is worried that he will be a burden.

Before that, I was at the Staples and around the Square, looking for food and giving it to friends. Before that, I stopped by the Whole Foods and scavenged what was gonna get thrown out.

Before that, I want to classes, and before that I was traveling to them from IC. I was a bit late, and I'm going to try to be early today.
